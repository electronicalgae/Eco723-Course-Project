ECO723: Regression Model Comparison Project
This project involves building and evaluating different regression models—specifically Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, and LSTM Neural Network—on a given dataset to compare their performance in predicting a target variable.

Objective
The main objective is to analyze and compare the predictive power and computational efficiency of:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

Based on the analysis, Linear Regression performs the best overall, while LSTM, despite being an alternative, is more computationally expensive.

Tools & Libraries Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy, Pandas
scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn

Model Evaluation
Each model is trained and evaluated on the same dataset using metrics like MSE/RMSE or R² (assumed). Visualizations help interpret the model fit and prediction accuracy.

Key Insights
Linear Regression outperformed other models in terms of simplicity and accuracy.
LSTM, although powerful, took significantly more time to train.
Random Forest showed moderate performance.
